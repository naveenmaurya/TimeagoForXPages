Timeago for XPages
================

This control allows you to show the date-time values as “XX seconds ago”, “XX minutes ago”, “XX days ago”, “XX months ago”, “XX year ago”. This control is based on the [jQuery plug-in Timeago](http://timeago.yarp.com/) which was ported to [Dojo by Michał Rączka](https://github.com/michaloo/dojo-timeago). 
 
**[Watch the control in action on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rxn9zBOI-Y)**
